# Model Context Protocol Servers in Quarkus/Java

This project contains a number of Quarkus/Java servers for the Model Context Protocol.

## jdbc

The `jdbc` server is a simple JDBC server that can be used to store and retrieve data from a JDBC database
given just a JDBC URL.

## filesystem

The `filesystem` server is a simple file system server that can be used to serve files from a file system.
